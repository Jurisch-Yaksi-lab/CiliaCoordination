We provide here additional information about the parameters for phase mapping for the identification of metachronal wave direction

##1. How are frequency maps segmented in space into equal-frequency patches? 

We realized early on that the power spectrum has a higher frequency resolution than necessary (0.1Hz) and that small variations in frequency could represent noise rather than cilia beating at different frequencies. Hence, we decided to bin the power spectrum (using a bin width of 0.54Hz). 
The precise choice of bin widths had only a small impact on the CBF segmentation (note that the spatial distribution of CBF remain similar). For bin widths grossly outside of this range, too few or too many CBF values result (see figure 4-supplement 1 below for a visual example). 
Based on our experiments with the multiciliated epithelium in the nose and brain of the zebrafish we would recommend to use a frequency binning of circa 0.5Hz
